# Class 7 Reading Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### Answering the call of the question is the first step in solving the issue at hand. If you don't know the problem, you can't possibly solve it

### Creating tables in HTML documents is an important skill to present data, effectively

### Constructors allow the developer to create many objects without having to write out too much code

## *Explain why we need domain modeling.*

### A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams

## *Why should tables not be used for page layouts?*

### Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users, tables produce tag soup, and tables are not automatically responsive

## *List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.*

### The table header (`<th>`) HTML element defines a cell as header of a group of table cells. The exact nature of this group is defined by the scope and headers attributes

### The table data cell (`<td>`) HTML element defines a cell of a table that contains data. It participates in the table model

### The table row (`<tr>`) HTML element defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established using a mix of `<td>` (data cell) and `<th>` (header cell) elements

## *What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?*

### 

## *How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?*

### 

## *Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.*
