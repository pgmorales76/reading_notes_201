# Class 10 Reading Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### Developers, invariably, make mistakes. Being able to fix those mistakes is a crucial skill to learn

### Knowing the proper tools and techniques to use for this purpose will make fixing those mistakes easier

## *Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.*

### **Syntax errors** are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through

### **Logic errors** are errors where the syntax is actually correct, but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results

## *List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.*

### `Undefined` - This error has been correctly by placing a variable outside the function it's defined. This can be fixed by placing it where it's defined

### `NaN` -  When I didn't code a math function correctly. This has been fixed by going through the code and making sure

### `Unexpected token` - When I've made a syntax error in my code. Sometimes, in, VS Code, there's no "quick fix". In that case, I have to go through the code and figure out where the error is. When a "quick fix" is available, VS Code fixed the problem

## *How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?*

### I view this topic as important is learning a technology. Because mistakes are going to occur, having the proper tools to fix them will help the code be better, in a quicker amount of time

## *How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?*

### The JS Debugger allows you to "watch" the code running and allows you to "pause", so you can find where an error is occuring. It's like watching a video of your code running

## *Define what a breakpoint is.*

### A breakpoint is a place in the code you want to pause execution, and identify the problems that prevent your code from running properly

## *What is the call stack?*

### The section that shows you where the code was executed, and how to get to that current line

## Things I Want to Know More About

### Is the only way to become proficient at debugging to make mistakes, maybe not purposely, but to not worry about making them in the first place?

### How do you balance not worrying about making mistakes and trying hard to not make them in the first place?
