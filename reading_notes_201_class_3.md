# Class 3 Reading Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### Lists are important because they're used all the time. Knowing which type of list element to use in a particular context gives your code a professional appearance

### In order to create complex layouts in CSS, you need to understand the box model and its effects on HTML elements

### Storing multiple bits of data in fewer codeblocks make your code more efficient

## *When should you use an `unordered list` in your HTML document?*

### The `<ul>` element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless

## *How do you change the `bullet style` of unordered list items?*

### The `type` attribute sets the bullet style for the list

## *When should you use an `ordered list` vs an `unordered list` in your HTML document?*

###

## *Describe two ways you can change the numbers on `list items` provided by an `ordered list`?*

### One attribute you can use is the `type` attribute, which will set the numbering type

### Another attribute you can use is the `reversed` attribute, which specifies the list's items are in reverese order. The list items will be numbered from high to low

## *Describe the CSS properties of `margin` and `padding` as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?*

### The **margin area**, bounded by the margin edge, extends the border area to include an empty area used to separate the element from its neighbors. Its dimensions are the *margin-box width* and the *margin-box height*

### The **padding area**, bounded by the padding edge, extends the content area to include the element's padding. Its dimensions are the *padding-box width* and the *padding-box height*

## *List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the `box model`.*

### The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes and defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content — work together to create a box that you can see on a page. Inline boxes use just some of the behavior defined in the box model

### Making up a block box in CSS we have the:

### **Content box**: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height

### **Padding box**: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties

### **Border box**: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties

### **Margin box**: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties

## *What `data types` can you store inside of an `Array`?*

###

## *Is the `people` array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?*

###

## *List **five** shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.*

###

## *Read the code below and evaluate the last `expression` and explain what the result would be and why.*

###

## *Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.*

###

## *Give an example of when a `Loop` is useful in JavaScript.*
