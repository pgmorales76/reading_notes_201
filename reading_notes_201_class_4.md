# Class 4 Reading Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### Links are make the web, a web! The very first web technology, HTML, is based off the idea of linking information between users. Without links, there no web to be world-wide

## *To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?*

### A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, inside an `<a>` element and using the `href` attribute, also known as a **Hypertext Reference**, or **target**, that contains the web address

    <p>
        I'm creating a link to
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
    </p>

## *The `href` attribute contains what information?*

### The URL that the hyperlink points to

## *What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?*

### The content inside a link should indicate where the link goes, even out of context

### You should only use a hyperlink for navigation to a real URL

### Links that open in a new tab/window via `target="_blank"`, or links that point to a download file should indicate what will happen when the link is followed

### Skip links could be used to let keyboard users bypass content repeated throughout multiple pages, such as header navigation

### Interactive elements, like links, should provide an area large enough that it is easy to activate them

### Interactive elements, like links, placed in close visual proximity should have space separating them
