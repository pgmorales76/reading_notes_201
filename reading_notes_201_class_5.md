# Class 5 Reading Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### This topic matters because accessibilty is important consideration in web development. Having as many users as possible should be the ideal. And always consider the following: never assume a user will experience a webpage the way you do. Everyone is different (and so am I!)

### A webpage with no color is, basically, a Word document or a page in a novel (not that there's anything wrong with that!). To give a user as aesthetically pleasing an experience as possible, should be the ideal to strive for in web development

## *What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?*

### The user is visually impaired, and is using a screen reader to read the web out to them

## *How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?*

### Having alt text available to describe images is useful to most users

### Provide text for search engines to utilize; search engines can match alt text with search queries

## *Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.*

### A semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the caption

## *Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.*

### `gif` is a good choice for simple images and animations

### `svg` is a vector image format; ideal for user interface elements, icons, diagrams, etc., that must be drawn accurately at different sizes

## *What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?*

### I would use an `svg` image because of its flexibility and accessibility advantages

## *Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.*

### Basically, the foreground is what's "closest" to you in an image. The background is what's further away

### At a fundamental level, the `color` property defines the foreground color of an HTML element's content and the `background-color` property defines the element's background color

## *Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?*

### I'd start off by asking them what colors they like. After they gave some idea of the colors they found to be aesthetically pleasing, I'd use a color wheel to find complimentary colors

## *What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?*

### Whether, or not, the font is included in the **Web Safe Fonts**

## *What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?*

### `font-size` sets the size of the font; `font-weight` sets the weight (or **boldness**) of the font; `font-style` sets whether a font should be styled with a normal, italic, or oblique face from its `font-family`

## *Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.*

### `Letter-spacing` and `word-spacing` properties allow you to set the spacing between letters and words in your text

## Things I Want to Know More About

### Given its accessibility advantages, is there a reason a developer shouldn't use `svg`?

### How did web safe fonts come to be chosen?
