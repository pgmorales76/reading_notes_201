# Class 14 Psychological Safety - Reading Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### Interacting with a team is what developers do every day. Learning what makes a great team (and what makes an individual a great team member) is necessary to performing any project, large or small

## *What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?*

### Members speaking in the same proportion, a phenomenon researchers refer to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking’’; high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues; and making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability

## *Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.*

### Most of my, recent, professional experience has been in a construction site setting. I can't think of an environment where psychological safety is the least of their concerns!

### Now, to play devil's advocate, for a moment, I think the reason for that is because physical safety is of paramount importance. Physical injury is more costly on a construction site, than if someone's feelings get hurt. That's the way the business is, for better or worse

### To the extent where working in a team is the environment in which you operate, there may be some give-and-take as to the details of the work being done

## *What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?*

### "To feel ‘psychologically safe,’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor."

### "Google, in other words, in its race to build the perfect team, has perhaps unintentionally demonstrated the usefulness of imperfection and done what Silicon Valley does best: figure out how to create psychological safety faster, better and in more productive ways."

## Things I Want to Know More About

### It seems a bit cliché to have one team of "all-stars" and a team of "regular Joe's", with the latter having more success. I mean, it seems like a story out of a lame movie. Why did Google choose the teams the way they did? Why not make the teams more similar, than dissimilar?

### I find it difficult to believe that having a team of competent people is worse than having a team who "gets along"
