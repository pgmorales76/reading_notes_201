# Class 12 Reading Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### The ability to draw shapes on the webpage enables a developer to create all kinds of applications and even games! This continues on the path of learning ways to make the user experience as pleasing as possible

### When we are presenting data, sometimes the numbers can get lost in translation. Having visual aids enables the presentation of data to be as pleasant an experience as possible, especially for those whose eyes glaze over when numbers are being presented

## *What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?*

### Charts are far better for displaying data, visually, than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create

## *How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?*

### Because we are dealing with data (numbers), having visual aids enables the user to consume the data in an easier way. Thus, making the presentation of data more aesthetically pleasing
