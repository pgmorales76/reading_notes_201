## Why This Topic Matters

###

## *Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.*

### In the article, we're considering a sidebar that sits, inline, with some content. Due to viewport space limitations, this demonstrates the advantages of flexbox

### One-dimensional content means either a row (x-axis) **OR** a column (y-axis). Two-dimensional would mean a row (horizontal) **AND** a column (vertical)

### Flexbox excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout. Flexbox not only helps lay the sidebar and content out inline, but where there's not enough space remaining, the sidebar will break onto a new line

## *Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.*
