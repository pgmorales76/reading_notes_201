# Class 1 Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### - These are the building blocks, on which the future material will be placed. In order to learn the complex, the simple needs to be understood, first

### *How HTTP sends data between computers*

#### 1. The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server the website lives on

#### 2. The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client

#### 3. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the website's files to the browser

#### 4. The browser assembles a complete web page and displays it to you

### *How HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser*

#### The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing CSS stylesheets and references to JS scripts

#### As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files and any JavaScript files, then parses the CSS and JavaScript

#### The browser generates a DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates CSS structure from the CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript

#### As the browser builds the DOM tree, applies the styles, and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content

### *How can you find images to add to a Website?*

#### Because most images on the web are copyrighted, the best way to go about finding usable images is to use Google's license filter

#### To do this, within the tools button on the browser, select the *Usage rights* option, and choose *Creative Commons licenses*

### *How do you create a `String` vs a `Number` in JavaScript?*

#### After you declare the variable, to create a `String`, enclose the value assigned to the variable in single quote marks

#### After you declare the variable, to create a `Number`, the value assigned to the variable is a digit such as `1` or `2`

### *What is a `Variable` and why are they important in JavaScript?*

#### A variable, in Javascript, is a container that stores a value

#### They're important because variables are needed for referencing values, in many places, throughout your code

### *What is an HTML attribute?*

### *Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element*

#### The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element, wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins

#### The content: This includes the content of the element

#### The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends

### *What is the Difference between `<article>` and `<section>` element tags?*

#### The `article` element wraps self-contained content in the HTML document, that's independent from the rest of the page

#### The `section` element wraps a generic section of the HTML document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to contain it

### *What Elements does a “typical” website include?*

#### A typical website will include the following elements: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`

### *How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?*

#### The `meta` element provides keywords for search engines to determine relevance of that page

### *How is the `<meta>` HTML tag used when specifying metadata?*

#### Specifying the document's character encoding; adding an author and description; favicons; applying CSS and JavaScript to a page; setting the primary language of the document
